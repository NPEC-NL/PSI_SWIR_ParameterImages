# PSI Hyperspectral Image Processing
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for preprocessing and extracting key vegetation-related indices from hyperspectral images captured with PSI SWIR (Short-Wave Infrared) cameras.

## üå± What This Notebook Does
The notebook processes hyperspectral .bil data files, applying radiometric calibration using associated dark and white reference images. It then calculates several plant-related indices:

NDWI ‚Äì Normalized Difference Water Index

MSI ‚Äì Moisture Stress Index

NDII ‚Äì Normalized Difference Infrared Index

Band @ 1000 nm ‚Äì Extracted calibrated reflectance slice

All outputs are saved as .tiff files for further analysis or visualization.

## üõ† How to Use This Notebook
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
Click below to open directly in Google Colab:

[Open PSI_Hyperspectral.ipynb in Colab](https://github.com/NPEC-NL/PSI_SWIR_ParameterImages/blob/main/PSI_Hyperspectral.ipynb)

2. Make a copy to your own Google Drive
Go to:
File > Save a copy in Drive

3. Upload or Mount Your Data
You can:

Upload .bil files directly

Or mount your Google Drive (/content/drive/MyDrive/...) containing your PSI hyperspectral data

Each measurement group must include:

*_Data.bil (Raw data)

*_Dark.bil (Dark reference)

*_White.bil (White reference)

4. Set input and output folders
Edit these variables in the notebook:

python
Copy
Edit
PATHinput = 'your_input_folder_path/'
PATHoutput = 'your_output_folder_path/'
FILE_NAME_key = 'SWIR'
5. Run the cells
Run the notebook from top to bottom. It will:

Automatically group related files

Calibrate raw images

Compute the indices

Save each output as .tiff images

## ‚úÖ Output
For each image group, you‚Äôll get:

groupname_ndwi.tiff

groupname_msi.tiff

groupname_ndii.tiff

groupname_wl1000.tiff
